# UFT-Based-Flight-Booking-Automation

Designed and executed a project utilizing Micro Focus UFT to automate flight booking. Leveraging the Micro Focus My Flight sample application, conducted rigorous testing across three distinct scenarios. Data was sourced from an MS Excel file, and the process was automated through VB scripting and Windows Scheduler integration. To ensure accuracy, implemented three types of checkpoints: standard, bitmap, and text. Comprehensive results were generated and presented in an HTML file for in-depth analysis and reporting.
